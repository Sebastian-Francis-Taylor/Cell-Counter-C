## Tasks
- [ ] **T1**: Read carefully the entire document to acquire a clear and complete understanding of the algorithm to be implemented.  
- [ ] **T2**: Design and structure the code (e.g., divide functionality into functions, decide function prototypes, choose buffers, etc.).  
- [ ] **T3**: Implement the design in C and perform unit tests to ensure new code sections work as expected.  
- [ ] **T4**: Test functionality and perform execution time and memory usage analysis.  
- [ ] **T5**: Perform optimizations and enhancements to improve detection rate, execution time, and memory usage.  
- [ ] **T6**: Test functionality again and analyze execution time and memory usage to demonstrate the impact of optimizations.  
- [ ] **T7**: Prepare a short report according to the provided instructions.
